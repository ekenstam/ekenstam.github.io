Ok, so why start blogging now?

I've always enjoyed writing and have considered starting a blog for several years now. In 2007 I created a site on BlogSpot mainly focused on my family life. But this was when Facebook was just starting to get wider acceptance and that seemed like a better tool for sharing wirh family and friends. On the professional side, I spent some time building out my LinkedIn page but still I was interested in something with a more narative format.

Not too long ago I used my home NAS to host a WordPress page. I also looked into hosting a WordPress server on AWS or subscribing to one of the many WordPress hosting services. But for the type of blogging I was interested to do (technical with lots of code snippets) WordPress didn't really seem to fit the bill. It also seems kinda over-kill for what I wanted to do.

Recently a colleague of mine, [Eing Ong][eing], sent an email with a link to one of her recent blog posts. That lead me to discover [GitHub Pages][github-pages] hosting and [Jekyll][jekyll-gh]. [GitHub Pages][github-pages] is free and seemed a natural fit for a technical blog and it's native support for [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] made it really easy to create an attractive site. Jekyll has a lot of support code examples and integration with GitHub. Using that combination makes a lot of sense for a blog primarily about code.

To make a long story short, I spent an evening playing around with [GitHub Pages][github-pages] and [Jekyll][jekyll-gh] and resolved to begin a periodic blog. I definately will not be blogging every day, and perhaps not every week or even month. But I do intend to blog whenever I feel I have a topic worth spending time on. The topics of this blog will mostly be technical and related to software development, but I may occasionally branch out into other topics such as management or corporate culture. But don't look here for cute cat videos, political ravings or [anything else you would feel uncomfortable discussing in a job interview][questions].

The first audience for this blog is, quite honestly, myself. I will use this as a mechanism to record my professional journey and document memorable milestones along the way. Writing stuff down, especially in a manner that would be coherent to others, will help me really _know_ the subject matter being discussed. By referring back to earlier posts I will be able to remember how exactly I did something. If this blog is useful to anyone else I'm happy for it, but that will be a fortunate side-effect.
